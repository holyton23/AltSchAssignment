This is my first assignment in Alt School Africa. Details of the assignment is written below:

I am to create a web page that displays my basic information, with ALT SCHOOL ID, a biography, relevant details explaining why I joined the program, and my goals for the School of Engineering program. 
Implementing a fragment identifier feature to enable scrolling back to the top of the page. 
To create a folder and name the file index.html 

To create a web page consisting of a form that mirrors the ALT SCHOOL application form (https://portal.altschoolafrica.com/auth/create-account), name the file form.html, connect the form.html to my first assignment via global navigation ensuring both files are in the folder of the first assignment, which should be at the top of both pages. I'm also to create a footer with my address and a copyright. 
It must also be accessible, incorporating appropriate semantic HTML tags.

Please note: This is at a beginner stage and it's expected not to include Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
